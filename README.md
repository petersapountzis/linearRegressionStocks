# linearRegressionStocks
Used Quandl API and Jupyter Notebook to create simple linear regression model to predict stock prices.
Followed [@TheCurryMan](https://github.com/TheCurryMan) and his site [The Codex](thecodex.com) to derive code. 
Still getting my feet wet with Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and machine learning.
